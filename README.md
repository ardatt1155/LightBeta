## RadiusSpark
This is a Spark+Scala application. 


#### Objective

The primary purpose of the assignment is to produce a simple data process from user files.
The main goal is to define a new phone marketing campaign for top 1000 users in order to upsell them with a new compelling product.

The data is fictitious and has been generated by a program but is representative of something that could have to be done in real life.
We have created the following files:

The transactions.txt file contains information about transactions. The structure of the file is the following: Customer ID, transaction amount, transaction date

The users.txt file contains information about users. The structure of the files is the following: Customer ID, Customer full name, email list, phone list 

The donotcall.txt file contains phone numbers that should not be used in the campaign

Select the top users based on highest transaction amount for year 2015. We wish to contact users using phone numbers that are not in the do not call list. As this is a phone campaign, there should be at least one phone number per user in the output. Save the campaign in a file using the following structure: Customer ID, Customer name, phone list that can be used to contact the user, total transaction amount


#### Solution

The application is just a solution.scala script file that can be executed in the Spark REPL via solution.sh
Here are the steps of mining.

(a) DnD is parsed and converted to an RDD that contains only tuple whose sole value is the sorted list of all telephones. Tuples are first trimmed and assumed valid if there are exactly ten digits after removing the characters ()-\b. 

(b) Transactions is transformed to an RDD that contains only tuples with their dates in 2015. Tuples are tested for sanity - check if the second-value is prefixed with a dollar symbol and subsequently contains a valid float value, check if the third value can be parsed into a valid date object. 

(c) Users is transformed to an RDD. Tuples are sanitized - check if uid contains non-blank characters, check if tuples contain at least four values, filter the fourth value for valid telephones. 

(d) Reachables is computed as a cartesian product of Users and DnD, and then tuples are filtered so the final RDD contains only users who are available by at least one telephone.

(e) Result is computed as a cartesian of Reachables and Transactions. This RDD then goes through transformations that include sorting-by-transaction-value and formatting-the-output.

(f) Result is saved as a textfile. Unix shell commands are used to pick the first 1000 tuples and write out the final campaign.txt

(g) Time-complexity is O(Dlog D + Tlog T + Ulog D + Ulog T + Ulog U). The algorithm avoids quadratic-terms in time-complexity. This assumes the Spark API _.cartesian smartly sorts the larger RDD, else add O(UT).

(h) donotcall.txt and transactions.txt looks like very clean data. users.txt seems to contain a lot of malformed data. Of 25000 tuples, only about 16670 tuples passed the sanitizations. The job takes about 45 seconds on a Macbook.
