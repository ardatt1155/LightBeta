==== Story ======
Playscout is a Scala REST application built with the Google Play framework. Playscout is a trivial CRUD application.
(a) The sole model is Advertisement which models a car-advertisement with the following fields : uid, title, fuel, price, mileage, state, registration.
(b) Playscout exposes 5 REST apis to expose a CRUD interface on this model. Refer to conf/routes for specification. See above for example usages
(c) The underlying data-store is a MySql server. You must initiate a database named Playscout in a server running somewhere, and configure the application to connect to it via conf/application.conf
(d) Playscout has a few sample testcases too. Errorhandling is not rigorous.
